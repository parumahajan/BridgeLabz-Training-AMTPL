**What I’ve Done:**
Today, I was given task by Kural sir, where I had to implement the git commands. After completing it, I gave the viva to Chandrashekhar sir.

**What I Will Do Next:**
I will revise the concepts of Git and .NET, and will practice the syntax of C#.

**Issues Faced:** 
While implementing git, I was unable to run the command "git add ."
It was giving error: adding files failed.
Then I created a .gitignore file, and wrote .vs/ in it.
After that, it worked.
